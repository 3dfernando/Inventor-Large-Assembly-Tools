UPDATE; Jan 2023:
I've received reports from many users of this add-in that it cannot be installed in Inventor 2022 and up. That's rather unfortunate, and it breaks my heart that Autodesk dropped the support like that. Unfortunately I personally don't have the time (nor the access to Inventor anymore) to update the software to fix this issue. 

Thanks for your kind words of support. Sincerely,
-Fernando Zigunov

=========================
Quick tutorial I made showing how to install this:

================================ENGLISH=================================
In order to install the last compiled version, copy the two *.dll files under
the folder 00 - Install\ to the folder \Program Files\Autodes\Inventor 20XX\bin

The DLLs need to be registered. I wrote the routine "00 - Register.cmd" to do that but 
it is programmed for Inventor 2014. You can edit the .cmd file through Notepad to change 
for the correct the file paths.

In the case you don't trust the .cmd or it's not working, here's the procedure to install it manually:

####USERS OF INVENTOR 2022:##### 
###I've been hearing from previous users that the 2022 update of Inventor breaks the add-in. I've not been able to follow up with this project, as I don't have the newest Inventor version. However, one of the users in the community has found a solution:

Go to this key in your registry
HKEY_CURRENT_USER \ SOFTWARE \ Autodesk \ Inventor \ RegistryVersion26.0 \ System \ Preferences
> Add DWORD value
LoadRegisterBasedAddins “= dword: 00000001

Apparently this instructs Inventor to load add-ins like mine, which are based on registry keys.
################################

1. Make sure you have the Microsoft .NET Framework v4.0.30319 or newer
2. Make sure you copied the files to the bin folder as described above
3. Open cmd as administrator
4. type in cmd the text below and press Enter:
	C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\RegAsm.exe /codebase "C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Inventor 20XX\bin\PDFemMassa.dll"

	*keep the quotes and replace XX by the year of your Inventor install

5. A message like "Type registration performed successfuly" should appear.
In case it doesn't or it throws an error, make sure you executed cmd as admin. Also make sure Inventor is closed.

6. If the installation was successful, when you open Inventor the buttons "Batch Renaming" and "Batch Export" will appear under the 
	tools ribbon and in the main menu.

================================PORTUGUÊS=================================
Para instalar a última versão compilada, é necessário copiar 
os dois *.dll dentro de "00 - Instalar" para a pasta \Arquivos de Programas\Autodesk\Inventor 20XX\bin

Além disso, é preciso registrar as dlls. A rotina "00 - Register.cmd" foi escrita com essa
finalidade, mas ela está programada para o Inventor 2014. Se você quiser programar para outra versão,
abra-a no bloco de notas e edite o caminho da pasta do Inventor.

Abaixo o que deve ser feito para instalar, caso desconfie ou não queira usar o *.cmd:

1. Abra o command prompt (Iniciar, pesquise por "cmd", execute como administrador)
2. digite:
C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\RegAsm.exe /codebase "C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Inventor 2014\bin\PDFemMassa.dll"

<Para isto você terá que ter o Microsoft .NET Framework v4.0.30319 ou superior.>

3. Deve aparecer uma mensagem "Registro de tipos efetuado com sucesso". Caso não apareça, verifique se executou como admin. Também tem que estar com o Inventor fechado nesta etapa.
4. Abra o Inventor e verifique se os novos botões da ferramenta aparecem nas barras de ferramentas Ribbon e no menu principal.
